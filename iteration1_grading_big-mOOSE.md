# Iteration 1

_(Grading based on commit `0431ec3dda7bee9aa1c12050591e71a30a5e797f`)_

## Requirement Specification (19/20)

- Looks great, I really like y'all's project, and I think you have a very strong start.
- Wireframes are beautiful and clear, great job!
- For the future iterations, and as your application gets more complex, please go into more depth on your __Software 
Architecture__. Even though some of it may be inconsequential to you, please let us know what you're using as your Database System,
if you're using any special python packages for middleware or pure Django, any additional packages or non-vanilla
Javascript on the front-end. If you end up using any stock front-end toolkits like Bootstrap or Ionic be sure to let us know as well :)

## Class Diagram (10/10)

- Class Diagram is clean and easy to understand, key is the cherry on top.
- If you don't end up adding more classes, consider spreading things out a bit, you have a lot of whitespace and
some cramped associations.

## Git Activities (14/15)

- Git branch looks fairly clean, good job using short concise branches.
- Once the project picks up complexity, consider using GitHub issues and the branch-per-issue workflow more. A branch
labeled "fix-frontend" suffers because you're gonna have to fix the frontend many more times. We would like our
branches to be as specific as the problems they're attempting to face. As a part of your project planning and evolution,
create GitHub issues where bugs appear or where features need to be implemented, and create a dedicated branch for that specific issue.
- Please make sure every member is committing to the repository somewhat equally! There was an _apparent_ inequity in the
amount of committing and work done for this iteration. I know that some teams have workflows that are focused around 
having everyone work on Zoom together and then having one person in charge of committing, if this is this case for
you guys, please make it clear in the next iteration's individual report.


## Github Project (10/10)

- Project board looks good and all tasks completed! Keep it up :)


## Implementation (20/20)

- Initial implementation looks great! User story was clearly implemented, and the initial cards look good.
- Make sure that you get a good grasp on the structure of your front-end code earlier rather than later, you don't
want to have to deal with a tangled hierarchy of React components! Map out your component hierarchy from the App down,
and separate out your components into files :)



## README (5/5)

- Readme looks good, full instructions were an hour late, be sure to be strict about the 11PM deadline, in the future
we won't look at any code committed after that deadline.

## Comments

#### Things Done Well

Great start y'all, I think you have a very strong app. Keep the project scope focused, and I think you're going to do
awesome. React components are already coming together nicely, and the code structure is relatively clean, keep it up!


#### Things That Can Be Improved

Like I said above, your Git structure looks great so far, consider adopting issues in order to keep it that way.
As the project grows in complexity, make sure everyone on the team is aware of what everyone else is doing, and
make sure that the distribution of work being done is equitable.
