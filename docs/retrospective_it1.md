# Retrospective - Iteration 1 

### What we did:
Created a database of static cards in Django and SQLite3 and displayed them on the website using React. We focused on linking the React and Django together moreso than focusing on the frontend look and functionality.

Cards (object) within a Deck (object)
-  want to add a filter function on the deck object so it only shows certain cards and we can begin to create a "schedule"
