# Retrospective - Iteration 1 

### What we did:
Created a database of static cards in Django and SQLite3 and displayed them on the website using React. We focused on linking the React and Django together moreso than focusing on the frontend look and functionality. We were able to accomplish loading data from the database into cards on the React page when users are taken to this landing page. We were not able to create a home page for a user's account, which we will get to in the next iteration.

### Challenges and How to Improve:
One of the challenges we faced that most of us had not used Django or React previously, so week 1 required some of us to learn these skills for the first iterations, while others who were more familiar implemented this. We plan on improving this by practicing and learning more about Django/React and splitting tasks so we can increase our efficiency.

Another challenge we faced was in how to order the categories of our cards so that we can filter the data from the database. This is so we can classify the data correctly when the user is selecting their preferences. This is something we will confirm on the design side and then start implementing.
