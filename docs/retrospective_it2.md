# Retrospective - Iteration 2 

### What we did:
 - Selection frontend: user click on skill categories
 - Backend: List of skills received, filtered, deck returned back
 - Course landing page: Login brings you to course page --> selection page
 - Course page backed
 - Added Login Page with validation 
 - animation and styling
 - Making sure everyone is on the same page 
 - Are able to pass data from front-end to backend
 - Re-modularized react componenets 
 - Learned about passing props from parent to child 

### Challenges:
 - Learning how to pass data and functions from parent to child in React components 
 - Working with button clicks - having them trigger a function
 - Urls in Django and how they interact with React 
 - Writing custom view functions in Django
 - Passing attributes through urls and into view functions
 - Re-modularizing react components, designing the structure for change/scalability
 - Getting the styling to apply to the correct components 

### How to Improve:
 - Starting earlier so that we aren't pressed for time
 - Catching everyone up quickly in terms of plans for the iterations and design decisions
 - Planning out who will do what and when before we start
