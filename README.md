# My Practice App

My practice app is a web application that creates a practice schedule for a specified field of interest. Currently there is only support for learning guitar. Upon opening the app, cards 
with different tasks are displayed with data from the database. 

## Architecture

The backend is being built using a framework called Django. We chose to use React for our frontend.

1) pip install django (make sure you have python installed)
