# My Practice App

My practice app is a web application that creates a practice schedule for a specified field of interest. Currently there is only support for learning guitar. Upon opening the app, cards 
with different tasks are displayed with data from the database. 

## Architecture

The backend is being built using a framework called Django. We chose to use React for our frontend. 

## Quickstart Guide

Before use, make sure you install the following

1) pip install django (make sure you have python installed)
2) check SQL configuration in intellij
3) install yarn https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/install/

Go into the directory root/mypractice

4) Run "python manage.py runserver" to start the Django server
5) Open a new terminal window and navigate to root/mypractice/card-frontend
6) Once inside the directory type "yarn start"

You should then see our web app in action! 


## Interation 1 Summary

1) Created models for django database
2) Created the frontend that renders cards with data pulled from the database
3) Everyone is learning React and Django!
